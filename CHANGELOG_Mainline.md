### Version 12.13 [ November 17th 2020 ]

**Early Message:**  
Real Change Log coming soon.. Servers went up early. This is for 9.0.2, the main change in this version is the way scaling works in the UI, using any scaling size you prefer should work much, much better. However, this is new and it still needs a little adjusting but overall experience with scaling should be a ton better. Also, the Unified Fonts setting was further adjusted to be exactly as it was pre-font changes.  

**Epic:**  
The new scaling adjustments are in place, which should allow you to select a custom scale that will keep borders intact better. This comes with new Small Medium and Large buttons to quickly adjust the scale *(Reload is required to properly change scale)*.  
Unified Font setting is now replicating old behaviour entirely.  
Druid multicrafting castbar is now fixed.
