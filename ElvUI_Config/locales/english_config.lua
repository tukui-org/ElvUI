Specific Searching:
    • q:[quality] or quality:[quality]. For instance, q:epic will find all epic items.
    • l:[level], lvl:[level] or level:[level]. For example, l:30 will find all items with level 30.
    • t:[search], type:[search] or slot:[search]. For instance, t:weapon will find all weapons.
    • n:[name] or name:[name]. For instance, typing n:muffins will find all items with names containing "muffins".
    • s:[set] or set:[set]. For example, s:fire will find all items in equipment sets you have with names that start with fire.
    • tt:[search], tip:[search] or tooltip:[search]. For instance, tt:binds will find all items that can be bound to account, on equip, or on pickup.


Search Operators:
    • ! : Negates a search. For example, !q:epic will find all items that are NOT epic.
    • | : Joins two searches. Typing q:epic | t:weapon will find all items that are either epic OR weapons.
    • & : Intersects two searches. For instance, q:epic & t:weapon will find all items that are epic AND weapons
    • >, <, <=, => : Performs comparisons on numerical searches. For example, typing lvl: >30 will find all items with level HIGHER than 30.


The following search keywords can also be used:
    • soulbound, bound, bop : Bind on pickup items.
    • bou : Bind on use items.
    • boe : Bind on equip items.
    • boa : Bind on account items.
    • quest : Quest bound items.
    • reagents, reagent, crafting : Profession reagents.
    • naval : Naval equipment.
    • follower, followe, follow : Follower items.
    • relic, reli, rel : Artifact Relics.
    • power, powe, pow : Items granting Artifact Power.]=]
