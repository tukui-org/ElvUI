		Even if your name is included in the list, I strongly suggest that you keep
		the original name of addon, because we are working with other authors
		to fix compatibility issues between them if they are found. Renaming it
		will break these fixes.

	4. 	This copyright notice shall be included in all copies or substantial

	Earlier versions were released under terms that did not require permission,
	but due to the actions of certain unscrupulous distributors, I have chosen
	to license all versions over v9 under stricter terms.
