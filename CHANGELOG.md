### Version 12.13 [ November 17th 2020 ]
*   **Early Message:**
    *   Real Change Log coming soon.. Servers went up early. This is for 9.0.2, the main change in this version is the way scaling works in the UI, using any scaling size you prefer should work much, much better. However, this is new and it still needs a little adjusting but overall experience with scaling should be a ton better. Also, the Unified Fonts setting was further adjusted to be exactly as it was pre-font changes.
*   **Epic:**
    *   The new scaling adjustments are in place, which should allow you to select a custom scale that will keep borders intact better. This comes with new Small Medium and Large buttons to quickly adjust the scale _(Reload is required to properly change scale)_.
    *   Unified Font setting is now replicating old behaviour entirely.
    *   Druid multi-crafting CastBar is now fixed.
*   **Rare:**
    *   All Individual UnitFrames were given Detached Power Bar setting.
    *   Currency Icons have a little border of their own now.
    *   Pet bar saturation would sometimes become stuck, it is now unstuck.
    *   Group Finder eye icon was sometimes behind the button itself, we moved the eyeball up some.
    *   Fixed up the Hide Button Glow on ActionBars, it was a bit funky before when implemented.
    *   Time DataText can now be used in multiple areas without getting confused about what time it actually is.
    *   Bags Item Level should be more accurate again.
    *   Chat has a Server Time setting now which can be used instead of Local Time.
    *   Target Aura Bars attached to Player Aura Bars should be offset correctly.
    *   Addon Manager skin was adjusted to allow searching by other addons.
    *   Added Top and Bottom for Custom Text on ActionBars.
    *   Fixed another Quest Skin but which prevented the Parchment from being shown sometimes with Parchment Remover disabled.

### Version 12.12 [ November 10th 2020 ]
*   **Woot:**
    *   Level Locked Spells on Action Bars will display more clearly when doing older instances with friends on a higher level character.
    *   Masque on Action Bars should once again trim correctly (when Keep Aspect Ratio is checked). The logic was a little off before. Should be okay now.
    *   Quest Icons on NamePlates would sometimes show the incorrect Icon on some mobs, this logic has been adjusted.
    *   The Quest Seal Color Text with Parchment Remover enabled should be more visible.
    *   Added custom font count and hotkey text options for Action Bars (Thanks @Caedis).
    *   Added custom color options for Cast Bars on UnitFrames (Thanks @Caedis).
    *   Increased the Cast Bar text offset options on UnitFrames.
    *   A couple Top Aura font issues resolved.

### Version 12.11 [ November 7th 2020 ]
*   **Sweet:**
    *   The Keybinds for disabled ActionBars will work again! Sorry this was overlooked.
    *   Corrected Count Font Outline on Top Auras, along with the border color being incorrect. Also, Apply All Fonts will a work for these again.
    *   Implemented a work around for the Quest Objective Tracker Icon being unusable sometimes in combat.
    *   Added a toggle for Action Button Glow incase you don't want to see procs happening.
    *   Seals were showing when Parchment Remover was enabled, should be hidden again now.
    *   Fixed the Mend Pet spell ID for Aura indicator on Pet.
    *   Added Show Level option for EXP Databar.

### Version 12.10 [ November 6th 2020 ]
*   **Hotfix:**
    *   Petbar wasn't appearing with the Backdrop option selected.
*   **Also:**
    *   Top Aura options were reworked and settings for them were reset.
    *   Added Custom Font options for Unitframe Castbars (Thanks @Caedis).

### Version 12.09 [ November 6th 2020 ]
*   **Sweet:**
    *   Nameplates were reset in the last version for some people who had a newer profile, sorry about that. That problem is corrected now.
    *   **/kb** was upgraded to also work on the microbar and bag items. You can now quickly bind from the Spell (binds by the Spell name) and Macro (binds by the Macro name), on Action buttons (binds to slot), or directly on Bag items (binds by Item ID, not the slot).
*   **Nice:**
    *   Quest Most Expensive Item icon is behaving now.
    *   Shadowed Unitframes wasn't playing nicely, should be okay now.
    *   Masque should play nicely again. However noting that unchecking Keep Aspect Ratio will affect Masque icons, keep it on if you want it to use the one intended for the skin you have selected.
*   **Okay:**
    *   Exp Databar would error sometimes.
    *   Microbar Visibility option would error sometimes.
    *   Adjustments to the Quest Skin to try to keep the text and backgrounds showing properly (again).

    *   Actionbar Button Spacing option can once again be set to up to -3.
    *   Added Party Indicator option for Unitframes (Thanks @Caedis).
    *   Backdrop on the Stance bar wasn't using the correct multiplier when less than the amount of buttons available.
    *   Backdrop on the Microbar was a little off, that is sorted.
    *   Added Honor Level to Honor bar text outputs.
    *   Fixed the last tick on castbars.

### Version 12.08 [ November 2nd 2020 ]
*   **Wonderful:**
    *   Ungoofed the Nameplate Thin Border option (under _General > Media > Borders_).
    *   Removed ultra rare hidden error with how we spawn the Talking Head Frame.
    *   Tweaked "Unified Font Sizes" a little more to mimic the older style and disabled it by default.

    *   Actionbar Buttons can be sized unproportionally now by unchecking the Keep Size Ratio option. This will let you make an EPIC looking bar.
    *   HelpTips will now be hidden with Hide Tutorials, even while in combat (it was protected for safety but seems okay without it).

With this release we have changed how we handle UI scale in ElvUI.

As a result we no longer set, or rely on, the CVar for UI scale. Because of this your UI scale has to be set again when you first log in with this new version.

We have done our best to make it a graceful transition, and as such you will be presented with a popup on your first log-in, where you can see what your old CVar value was, and choose to use this value. You can also choose to have a UI scale calculated for you, or simply set it manually in the config.

From now on you can choose your UI scale within the ElvUI config, or press the "Auto Scale" button to use the value that was previously considered most optimal for your resolution.

### Version 10.48 [ April 5th 2017 ]
*   **New Additions:**
    *   None
*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Fixed display issue with the Micro Bar.

### Version 10.47 [ March 29th 2017 ]
*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Fixed error when trying to import invalid profile table.
    *   Fixed issue which prevented actionbutton icons from updating.
    *   Fixed error caused by attempt to skin non-existent options for Mac.
    *   Fixed the "Darken Inactive" setting for stance bar.
*   **Noteworthy Info:**
    *   The friendly nameplates in dungeons and raids are currently broken. While in a dungeon or raid instance the default WoW nameplates are supposed to be active. Unfortunately this is not the case when the ElvUI NamePlates module is enabled. There is no easy fix for it, as the issue is with how the nameplate module was initially written. For the time being you will have to either play without friendly nameplates in those situations, or disable the ElvUI NamePlates module and use a dedicated addon for NamePlates. We apologize for the inconvenience.

### Version 10.46 [ March 28th 2017 ] (for patch 7.1.5 and 7.2)

*   **Misc. Changes:**
    *   Implemented changes to support the new patch 7.2.
    *   Made various skin tweaks according to latest FrameXML changes.
    *   Enhanced the code which calculates Artifact Power in bags for the Artifact DataBar.
*   **Noteworthy Info:**
    *   Because of a change Blizzard made to friendly nameplates in 7.2, it is no longer possible to modify them in dungeons and raid instances. If you use friendly nameplates in those situations then you will notice that they use the default WoW style. There is nothing we can do about that.

    *   You can now open a sub-section of the ElvUI config directly through the /ec command. This requires that you supply the path to the config page as a comma-separated list. The path needs to match the table structure of the config exactly (in code, not as displayed ingame). Example: "/ec unitframe,player,portrait".
    *   Added E:IgnoreCVar(cvarName, ignore) API. This can be used to tell ElvUI that it should not automatically change a specific CVar which had previously been locked in place by ElvUI.
